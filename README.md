# kuzzzzz.github.io
just another repo to store my test projects and files

I feel I have left my GitHub, inactive for a while now and this doesn't actually represent my current coding activity, but to recruiters and potential employers, this may look bad as I am currently unemployed formally. 

I have been coding mainly in the background to improve me DSA and Nodejs skills, watching tutorials on youtube, and trying
to build many mini projects, some of which I don't consider GitHub worthy, and some I am just too lazy to push to GitHub to get my green checkbox.  

All that is about to change, I hope.  I want to try and start making regular commits and fill up my graph with Green squares for the rest of the year.  Hopefully, I'll make a commit every day, using this readMe to leave a small note like this, on the things I worked on that day, what I plan to work on in the future, and the steps I am trying to take to achieve my goal of becoming a
software engineer at a company doing meaningful work.
